    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to build a classifier that predicts whether a customer will soon stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. This is a binary classification problem, where the target variable indicates whether a customer churns or not. The insights generated from this project will help SyriaTel to take proactive measures to reduce customer churn, which directly impacts the companyâ€™s revenue and profitability."

    "## 2. Business Understanding:\n",
    "Customer churn is a critical issue for telecommunications companies like SyriaTel, as acquiring new customers is often more costly than retaining existing ones. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, SyriaTel can implement targeted retention strategies, such as offering discounts or personalized services, to keep those customers from leaving. The aim is to minimize revenue loss and enhance customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project focuses on identifying patterns in customer behavior that indicate the likelihood of churn. These patterns can include factors like customer service interactions, usage metrics, and contract details. The goal is to create a predictive model that can classify customers as churners or non-churners with high accuracy, enabling the company to intervene before a customer leaves."

    "## 3.Data Understanding:\n",
    "The dataset, titled \"Churn in Telecom's dataset,\" contains information on customers, including various features related to customer demographics, account information, usage metrics, and more. The key challenge is to understand how these features contribute to the likelihood of a customer churning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features: These include demographic data (e.g., age, gender), service usage metrics (e.g., number of calls, data usage), customer service interactions, contract details (e.g., contract type, tenure), and payment methods.\n",
    "Target Variable (y): The target variable is binary, indicating whether a customer has churned or not.\n",
    "Class Distribution: It's essential to assess the distribution of the target variable to understand if the dataset is balanced or if one class (e.g., churners) is underrepresented."
